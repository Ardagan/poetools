# poepickup

poepickup is a tool that will automatically pickup POE loot within screen.

It selects items to pickup based on tag color.

## Usage

* Start the application.
* Switch to the game
* Press respective hotkey while in the game
	* [ -> exit application
	* ] -> pick up items
	* \ -> cherry-pick color under the coursor and output it to console
	
If you plan to cherry-pick color, keep in mind that when you hover over the item in POE, it will change color to highlighted one.
To avoid highlighting, you can switch to another application and keep POE in the background. This will not trigger the highlighting 
mechanics when you hover your mouse over the item tag.

## Config
If you want to check configs or modify them to suit your needs, edit `config.json`.

In this file you can set hotkeys that poepickup will utilize and specify colors to search for on screen.

Follow existing pattern to specify values.
